# Evidence for telemetry-attribution

Screenshots, recordings and logs to attach to the upstream PR (see the Demo
section of `../PR.md`). Upload them as GitHub attachments on the PR rather
than committing them, unless they are small and useful to keep here.

Capture them on a clean, throwaway Omnigent server with dummy data: a fresh
`OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR`, scratch projects and repositories, and no real accounts,
sessions, hostnames or credentials in view. Redact anything else before
sharing.

To capture:

- attach a span's attribute list from the collector (dummy user), once with user capture off (runner id only) and once on (runner id and `enduser.id`)
